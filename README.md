# .dotfiles
My basic configuration files for git, vim etc.

Run the bash script to create symlinks to all the config files. If you wish to add dotfiles to you home directory add them to the home/ folder. For folders located within ~/.config folder add your own folder and add a function call in the bash script with it's name.
